Recently, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to researchers, scientists, health professionals, and administrations around the globe from its detection to its treatment. The whole world is witnessing a lockdown-like situation because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Persistent efforts are being made by the researchers to obtain possible solutions to control this pandemic in their respective areas. One of the most common and effective methods applied by researchers is the use of CT scans and X-rays to analyze the images of the lungs for COVID-19. However, it requires several radiology specialists and time to manually inspect each report, which is one of the most challenging tasks in a pandemic. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning neural network-based method nCOVnet, an alternative fast screening method that can be used for detecting COVID-19 by analyzing the X-ray of patients which will look for visual indicators found in the chest radiography imaging of COVID-19 patients.
